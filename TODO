TODO

Make Context accept instances
Like this we can create a PropGroup (Contents) with "Properties" which are actually saved instances
not lots of work but will be easier to implement buckets or other stuff

Change IntentionService to handle Tool action caches;
tool action cache itself should be update
CommandsServer should be rewrited to work with Dmans and Statmans

Let commands overflow from :Run to :RunServer. 

Make a FIFO class. Necessary for Default actions, as least-priority actions are currently popped first.
Other solution is just to create a PutFirst for actions where table.insert()

Add cooldown API to tools

Add the SetProperty on client to work with server calls

TODO: CoolDown should be implemented into ToolService.


Make the a ctiosn work. Cache first, then put handlers to do action and registre the already existing actions
